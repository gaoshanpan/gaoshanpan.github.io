| Definition of problem or issue in context |  | Describes the problem or issue.  | Provides a basic definition of the problem or issue, and shows that the problem or issue is situated in a context.  | Provides an informative definition of the problem or issue, shows that the problem or issue is situated in a context, shows understanding of the main features of that context and explains why these matter, defines key terms, identifies desirable features of possible solutions. | Insightful and articulate. Analyses a context by consulting a suitably broad range of informational sources, identifies and appropriately frames a problem or issue within that context, gives a detailed and clear definition of the problem or issue, explains why this problem or issue matters, sets out criteria against which to measure possible solutions. |
| Critical questioning of ideas, evidence and assumptions |  | Listens to and understands the ideas of others. | Recognises that ideas, evidence and assumptions need to be examined, shows awareness of differences in perspective, shows sensitivity to possible bias and error, seeks out those who have knowledge and expertise. | Questions received ideas, evidence and assumptions, engages with the work of genuine experts, critiques fallacious rhetoric, engages in rational argument, assesses currently available evidence, provides evidence to justify conclusions. | Open-minded and intellectually rigorous. Critically examines received ideas, evaluates the credibility and the methodology of experts, engages with competing views from various historical, intercultural and interdisciplinary perspectives, locates and assesses new evidence. |
| Creation and evaluation of hypotheses or alternative arguments |  | Identifies and understand hypotheses put forward by others. | Recognises that current hypotheses and arguments may be suboptimal, assesses the existing hypotheses and arguments. | Generates new hypotheses and arguments, shows awareness of how they could be compared and tested, carries out these tests. | Creative and judicious. Generates original hypotheses and arguments, tests relevant hypotheses and arguments via reasoning, observation, or experiment, evaluates the results. |
| Formulation of defensible conclusions and best possible solutions |  | Recognises conclusions and solutions offered by others. | Formulates basic solutions or conclusions. | Offers a solution or conclusion based on engagement with the relevant evidence, defends this solution or conclusion in light of relevant evaluative criteria. | Wise and decisive. Decides on the balance of the evidence, formulates conclusion or solution clearly in their own words, identifies the proper scope and significance of the conclusion commensurate with methods used, explains why this conclusion or solution is best when measured against relevant evaluative criteria.  |
