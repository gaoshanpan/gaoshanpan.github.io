| Component | Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Definition of problem or issue in context |  | Describes the problem or issue.  | Provides a basic definition of the problem or issue, and shows that the problem or issue is situated in a context.  | Provides an informative definition of the problem or issue, shows that the problem or issue is situated in a context, shows understanding of the main features of that context and explains why these matter, defines key terms, identifies desirable features of possible solutions. | Insightful and articulate. Analyses a context by consulting a suitably broad range of informational sources, identifies and appropriately frames a problem or issue within that context, gives a detailed and clear definition of the problem or issue, explains why this problem or issue matters, sets out criteria against which to measure possible solutions. |
| Critical questioning of ideas, evidence and assumptions |  | Listens to and understands the ideas of others. | Recognises that ideas, evidence and assumptions need to be examined, shows awareness of differences in perspective, shows sensitivity to possible bias and error, seeks out those who have knowledge and expertise. | Questions received ideas, evidence and assumptions, engages with the work of genuine experts, critiques fallacious rhetoric, engages in rational argument, assesses currently available evidence, provides evidence to justify conclusions. | Open-minded and intellectually rigorous. Critically examines received ideas, evaluates the credibility and the methodology of experts, engages with competing views from various historical, intercultural and interdisciplinary perspectives, locates and assesses new evidence. |
| Creation and evaluation of hypotheses or alternative arguments |  | Identifies and understand hypotheses put forward by others. | Recognises that current hypotheses and arguments may be suboptimal, assesses the existing hypotheses and arguments. | Generates new hypotheses and arguments, shows awareness of how they could be compared and tested, carries out these tests. | Creative and judicious. Generates original hypotheses and arguments, tests relevant hypotheses and arguments via reasoning, observation, or experiment, evaluates the results. |
| Formulation of defensible conclusions and best possible solutions |  | Recognises conclusions and solutions offered by others. | Formulates basic solutions or conclusions. | Offers a solution or conclusion based on engagement with the relevant evidence, defends this solution or conclusion in light of relevant evaluative criteria. | Wise and decisive. Decides on the balance of the evidence, formulates conclusion or solution clearly in their own words, identifies the proper scope and significance of the conclusion commensurate with methods used, explains why this conclusion or solution is best when measured against relevant evaluative criteria.  |

# reflection writing
“Try making the conscious effort to reflect on the link between your experience and the theory, policies or studies you are reading”

Williams et al., Reflective Writing
Writing a reflective essay
When you are asked to write a reflective essay, you should closely examine both the question and the marking criteria. This will help you to understand what you are being asked to do. Once you have examined the question you should start to plan and develop your essay by considering the following:

What experience(s) and/or event(s) are you going to reflect on?
How can you present these experience(s) to ensure anonymity (particularly important for anyone in medical professions)?
How can you present the experience(s) with enough context for readers to understand?
What learning can you identify from the experience(s)?
What theories, models, strategies and academic literature can be used in your reflection?
How this experience will inform your future practice
When structuring your reflection, you can present it in chronological order (start to finish) or in reverse order (finish to start). In some cases, it may be more appropriate for you to structure it around a series of flashbacks or themes, relating to relevant parts of the experience.

...
Example Essay Structure
This is an example structure for a reflective essay focusing on a single experience or event:

Introduction

What the essay is about
What you are focusing on
Why this is important
What the context/background is (general statement on reflective practice)
Definition of any problematic terms
Part 1

Description of the experience
 
Part 2

Feelings/responses to the experience
 
Part 3

Reflection during the experience (immediate action)
 
Part 4

What was good or bad about the experience?
 
Part 5

Reflection after the experience
What sense can you make of the situation? (Include sources from your study to help explain and analyse the situation)
Part 6

What general conclusions do you draw? What else could be done?
 
Part 7

What would you do differently?
 
Conclusion

Summarise the main points
 
 

Summary:
When you are writing a reflective assessment, it is important you keep your description to a minimum. This is because the description is not actually reflection and it often counts for only a small number of marks. This is not to suggest the description is not important. You must provide enough description and background for your readers to understand the context.

You need to ensure you discuss your feelings, reflections, responses, reactions, conclusions, and future learning. You should also look at positives and negatives across each aspect of your reflection and ensure you summarise any learning points for the future.
