# Linux操作实验log — Note

---

## Basics

* Linux is **case-sensitive**: `echo`, `Echo`, `ECHO` are all different.
* Similar to `print` in Python, `cout` in C++.

**Example**:

```bash
echo "Hello world"
```

---

### Display Current User

```bash
whoami
```

```
gaoshanpan
```

### Get User Information / Group Info

```bash
id
```

```
uid=5000(labex) gid=5000(labex) groups=5000(labex),27(sudo),121(ssl-cert),5002(public)
```

**Breakdown**:

* **uid**: User ID
* **gid**: Primary group ID
* **groups**: All groups you are a member of

👉 `root` is the **superuser**, like the administrator of the system.

---

### Installing Software

Software installation uses a **package manager**. Downloading/installing software should use package manger, which is like an App Store for your phone. `apt` is a widely used package manager for Debian-based systems, such as Ubuntu.

**Example**: Install `htop` (system monitor). It's like a dashboard that gives you a real-time view of what's happening inside your computer.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install htop
```
**In screenshot, htop shows:**
* **Top**: CPU and memory usage, as well as how long your computer has been running (uptime).
* **Middle**: A list of all the running programs (processes).
* **Bottom**: Options for interacting with htop.

👉 Use arrow keys to navigate, `q` to quit htop when you're done.

---

### Summary (Basics)

* Open & use the terminal
* Basic commands: `echo`, `whoami`, `id`
* Install software (`sudo apt install htop`)
* Monitor system performance (`htop`)

## Basic File Operations

* `cd ..` → Move up one level
* `ls ..` → List contents of parent directory
* `ls ~` → List home directory
* `touch file1.txt` → Create empty file (or update timestamp if it exists)
* `echo "Hello, Linux" > file2.txt` → Write to file
* `echo "Hidden file" > .hiddenfile` → Create hidden file

**Listing Files**

* `ls -l` → Long format (permissions, owner, size, date)
* `ls -a` → Show hidden files

**Move / Rename**

* `mv file1.txt newfile.txt` → Rename
* `mv newname.txt testdir/` → Move file to directory
* `mv testdir_copy new_testdir` → Rename directory
* `mv testdir/newname.txt ./original_file1.txt` → Move + rename

**Remove**

* `rmdir dirname` → Remove empty directory
* `rm file` → Remove file
* `rm -rf dir` → Recursive & force delete (**⚠ dangerous**)

⚠ **Be careful with `rm -rf`.** Example:

```bash
rm -rf /
```

A small typo could delete critical system files or your personal data. There is no undo. For example, rm -rf / could attempt to delete your entire system (if you have permissions). Always double-check the path.

**Other Useful**

* `pwd` → Print working directory
* `echo ~` → Display home directory
* `cp -r` → Copy files/directories recursively

---

### Summary (Files)

* Navigate: `cd`, `pwd`
* Create: `touch`, `mkdir`
* List: `ls`, `ls -a`, `ls -l`
* Copy: `cp -r`
* Move/Rename: `mv`
* Delete: `rm`, `rmdir`

---

## File Contents & Comparing

* `cat -n file.txt` → Show file with line numbers
* `head -n1 file.txt` → First line
* `head -c1 file.txt` → First byte
* `tail -n1 file.txt` → Last line
* `tail -c2 file.txt` → Last 2 characters

**Compare Files**

```bash
diff file1 file2
```

```
1c1
< this is file1
---
> this is file2
```

**Compare Directories**

```bash
diff -r ~/Desktop ~/Code
diff -r ..
```

**Manual**

```bash
man cat
```

---

## File Permissions

Example:

```
-rw-rw-r--
```

* First char: file type (`-` regular file, `d` directory)
* Permissions: read (4), write (2), execute (1) → add up for each digit

**Change Ownership**

```bash
sudo chown root:root example.txt
```

* `sudo` → Run with root privileges
* `chown` → Change owner
* `root:root` → Owner & group set to root
* `example.txt` → Target file
