## Evidence
How to start a conversation relating to any topics, both trivial and serious topics. 

A frame:
 1. set the goal (what you wanna talk about)
 
 2. set up a clear vision(how you wanna this conversation would end)
 3. put them in frame

Example: "1.Hi, Ken, I'd like to talk to you about tomorrow's meeting.2.I wanna walk to the way that we are on the same page.3.that sounds good?

Example: 

 This is not about manipulation, but to help lead this conversation to a positive direction for both sides.
