| Scope of an information need |  | Identifies main concepts when researching a straightforward question or problem, with minimal reference to context. | Uses the context of an information need to inform its scope | Adapts approaches from multiple disciplines and uses them in more complex/specialised contexts | Produces novel insights and approaches. |
| Location of data and information  |  | Applies commonly used search tools and strategies provided to access and select data and information  | Evaluates a variety of search strategies and sources and selects an appropriate set of these to use | Makes sophisticated use of search strategies and sources appropriate to a disciplinary context | Critiques and creates well-designed search strategies and makes innovative choices of sources |
| Interpretation and evaluation of sources |  | Applies basic criteria provided to judge the appropriateness of data and information and gives meaning within a defined context  | Independently applies basic criteria to judge the value of information in a disciplinary context | Adapts criteria recognised within disciplines to judge the appropriateness of data and information and extracts multiple meanings. | Creates and justifies innovative criteria to judge the appropriateness of data and information and systematically constructs insightful meanings from multiple perspectives. |
| Adaptation, integration and synthesis |  | Uses basic techniques to extract and organise information and data  | Selects and applies basic extraction and synthesis techniques to organise more complex information    | Extracts information from multiple sources, and, organises and synthesises it coherently to satisfy a clear purpose | Extracts information in innovative ways, and, organises and synthesises data to create new knowledge. |
| Use of digital resources, tools, and strategies  |  | Uses basic digital tools and strategies in simple ways under close supervision and guidance  | Uses basic and intermediate digital tools and strategies in simple ways with minimal supervision and guidance | Applies best practice approaches when using digital tools and strategies and shows evidence of independently learning to use new and more sophisticated techniques | Evaluates and uses advanced features of digital tools in sophisticated ways and shows evidence of independently learning to use a diverse range of new tools and strategies in innovative ways. |
